**Welcome to iFM-Radio.**
This is an app developed by a 15 year old teenager using Swift / SwiftUI and Xcode 15.
My name is Iker and I code everyday so I can archive my dream: being a professional developer.
(I would like to work as a **iOS Developer** in a future.) 💻📲
**Who knows**, maybe nex year I win the **Swift Student Challenge**. 

**Features:**
- JSON Decoding and fetching from a server (stored at: jsonbin.io) 🛜
- Radio Streaming using AudioStreaming(a Swift package from user "dimitris-c") 📻
- Search, where you can search by tag, name, see the raw list of Radios using a GridView or watching the list by tag. 🔎
- Filtering by favourite Radios ♥️
- PlayerView where you can set a timer for stoping the streaming or like/favourite your radio. ⏰❤️
- System integrated media controls (Control Centre / Lock Screen) 🔒
- withAnimation instances so it looks way smoothy🤤 

**Special Thanks to:**
