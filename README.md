**Welcome to iFM-Radio.**
This is an app developed by a 15 year old teenager using Swift and Xcode 15.
My name is Iker and I code everyday so I can upgrade my knowledge about coding.
I would like to work as a **iOS Developer** in a future.

**Special Thanks to:**

- OpenCoreLegacyPatcher(https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher), for giving a second life to old MacBooks.
- My fathers for giving me all I need for learning development.
