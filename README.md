**Welcome to iFM-Radio.**
This is an app developed by a 15 year old teenager using Swift and Xcode 15.
My name is Iker and I code everyday so I can upgrade my knowledge about coding.
I would like to work as a **iOS Developer** in a future.
**Features:**
- JSON Decoding and fetching from a server (stored at: jsonbin.io)
- Radio Streaming using AudioStreaming(a Swift package from user "dimitris-c")
- TabView with two pages:
- Explore, an organized list with all Radios.
- Search, where you can search by tag, name or see the raw list of Radios using a GridView.
- Filtering by favourite Radios
- PlayerView where you can set a timer for stoping the streaming or like/favourite your radio.
- System integrated media controls (Control Centre / Lock Screen)
**Special Thanks to:**
- AudioStreaming(https://github.com/dimitris-c/AudioStreaming)
- OpenCoreLegacyPatcher(https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher), for giving a second life to old MacBooks.
- JSONBin.io for letting 10.000 free calls to the server.
- My fathers for giving me all I need (and more) for learning development.
